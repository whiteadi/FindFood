# Find Food Recipes App in React Native

I used the starter kit: <a href="https://github.com/instamobile/recipes-app-react-native">Recipes App in React Native</a>, I've changed the React components from classes to functional and used hooks here and there.

Also the api used is the recipes API from the <a href="https://www.themealdb.com/api.php">MealDB.</a>

## Getting Started
To run the app, simply run

``` yarn && expo start ```

And scan the QR code in the Expo client app.

### TODO
