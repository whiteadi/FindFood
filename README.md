# Find Food Recipes App in React Native

I used the starter kit: <a href="https://github.com/instamobile/recipes-app-react-native">Recipes App in React Native</a>, I've changed the React components from classes to functional and used hooks here and there.

Also the api used is the recipes API from the <a href="https://www.themealdb.com/api.php">MealDB.</a>

I used the list of ingredients from MealDB and added myself <a href="https://github.com/whiteadi/FindFood/blob/master/src/ingredients.js">images</a> for all. (feeback on that welcomed)
